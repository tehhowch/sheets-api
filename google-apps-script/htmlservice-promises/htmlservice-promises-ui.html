<!--
This simple HTML file shows how you can create a client-side function that will
call any non-private Apps Script function in the associated Script Project, and
return a native `Promise`, allowing you to use Promise methods such as `all`,
`then`, and `catch`, and avoiding nested "callback hell" situations.

Note: if you support a browser that doesn't have support for arrow syntax, rest
parameters, or Promises, you absolutely will need to polyfill that. But, I'm not
even sure why you're trying to use this in that situation, anyway ;)
